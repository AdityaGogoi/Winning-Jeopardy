# Winning-Jeopardy
Analyze text while figuring out strategies to win at Jeopardy using Python.

Introduction:-

Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades, and is a major force in popular culture.
Let's say you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any edge you can get to win. In this project, I'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help us win.

The dataset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions.
Each row in the dataset represents a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy. Here are explanations of each column:

1. Show Number -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.
2. Air Date -- the date the episode aired.
3. Round -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.
4. Category -- the category of the question.
5. Value -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.
6. Question -- the text of the question.
7. Answer -- the text of the answer.
